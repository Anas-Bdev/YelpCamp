About This Project:
I started learning web programming over a year ago by enrolling in a web development course on Udemy taught by Colt. After many months of studying front-end and back-end concepts, I began working on this project as part of the course.

The projectâ€™s idea revolves around creating camping sites for each user, allowing them to add reviews, and featuring a map to display the location of each campsite.

This project has significantly helped me improve my web development skills, especially in back-end programming through working with databases.
