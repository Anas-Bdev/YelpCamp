About This Project:
I started learning web development over a year ago by taking a Udemy course. After months of studying both front-end and back-end concepts, I created this project as part of the course.

The project allows users to create and manage camping sites, add reviews, and view campsite locations on an interactive map.

Working on this project helped me strengthen my web development skills, particularly in back-end programming and database management.
