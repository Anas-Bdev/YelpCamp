I started learning web programming more than a year ago when I registered in a website development course on Udemy with the teacher Colt. After many months of studying the concepts of front-end and back-end programming, I started working on this project for the course. The idea of ​​the project revolves around creating camping sites for each user and the possibility of adding reviews to them in addition to the presence of a map showing the location of the camping site. This project helped me develop my level in website programming, especially in back-end programming by dealing with databases.
